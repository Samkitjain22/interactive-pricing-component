## 📚 What I learned
While working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:

- Implementing dynamic pricing calculations using JavaScript based on slider input.
- Managing theme toggling (light/dark mode) with CSS variables and JavaScript event handling.
- Creating responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox with a mobile-first approach.
- Handling user interactions like drag-and-drop sliders and keyboard accessibility.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Pricing Slider** – Adjusts the price and page views based on slider position (10K to 1M pageviews with corresponding prices).  
- **Billing Toggle** – Switches between monthly and yearly billing, applying a 25% discount for yearly plans.  
- **Theme Toggle** – Switches between light and dark modes with CSS variables.  
- **Currency Selection** – Allows switching between USD, EUR, and INR, updating the currency symbol and price accordingly.  
- **Add-ons** – Adds optional premium support or extra storage costs to the base price.  
- **Save Preferences** – Saves user settings (slider value, billing type, add-ons, currency) in `localStorage`.  
- **Discount Code** – Applies a one-time $2 discount with the code `"SAVE25"`.  
- **Comparison Tool** – Displays a comparison of plans via an alert.  
- **Testimonial Slider** – Automatically cycles through user testimonials every 5 seconds.  
- **Responsive Design** – Adapts layout and styling for mobile and desktop screens.  
- **Consistent Button Styling** – All interactive buttons (e.g., "Start my trial", "Save for Later", "Compare Plans", "Apply") share the same design.
